## MATPLOTLIB
What is **matplotlib**?

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

### **Here's what we can do using matplotlib:**
* **Basic**: Basic plot types, usually y versus x.
* **Plots of arrays and fields**: Plotting for arrays of data Z(x, y) and fields U(x, y), V(x, y).
* **Statistics plots**: Plots for statistical analysis.
* **Unstructured coordinates** : Sometimes we collect data z at coordinates (x,y) and want to visualize as a contour. Instead of gridding the data and then using contour, we can use a triangulation algorithm and fill the triangles.
* **3D** : 3D plots using the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d library.

## SEABORN
